# wtf is this?
i yote (yeeted?) some functions i use regularly for my lab asignements and also some wrappers around pyplot together.

Some of it might not work.
It's not coded well.
The function interfaces might not be consistent.

but feel free to use it if it helps you...


# why??
i wanted the annoying and tedious lab assignements for uni to be a bit more readable and easier and faster to write.


# how to use (if you're mad enough)
just pip install this repo and then look into the example project.
if you know me personally: feel free to text me. if not: sad for you i guess.
